# CI/CD Setup Complete

## Overview

The AWS AI Practitioner Quiz application now has a complete, production-ready CI/CD pipeline following the simplified two-environment strategy as requested.

## Branch Strategy

### ✅ Development Branch (`dev`)
- **Purpose:** Active development and testing
- **Auto-deployment:** Development environment
- **Workflow:** `deploy-complete.yml`
- **Domain:** API Gateway endpoint (no custom domain)
- **Stack:** `quiz-infrastructure-dev`

### ✅ Production Branch (`main`)
- **Purpose:** Production-ready code
- **Auto-deployment:** quizaxis.com production site
- **Workflow:** `deploy-production.yml`
- **Domain:** quizaxis.com (custom domain + SSL)
- **Stack:** `quiz-infrastructure-prod`

## Workflows Summary

| Workflow | Trigger | Environment | Purpose |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| `deploy-complete.yml` | Push to `dev`, PR to `main` | Development | Test changes before production |
| `deploy-production.yml` | Push to `main` | Production | Live deployment to quizaxis.com |
| `deploy-infrastructure.yml` | Manual only | Configurable | Infrastructure-only updates |
| `deploy-dev.yml` | Manual only | Development | Legacy (disabled) |

## Documentation Created

- **[Workflows README](.github/workflows/README.md)** - GitHub Actions workflow documentation

## Development Process

### Standard Feature Development
```bash
# 1. Start from dev branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# 2. Develop and commit
# Make changes, test locally
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature"
git push origin feature/your-feature

# 3. Deploy to development
# Create PR to dev branch
# Merge triggers automatic deployment to development environment

# 4. Test in development
# Verify functionality at development API Gateway endpoint

# 5. Deploy to production
# Create PR from dev to main
# Merge triggers automatic deployment to quizaxis.com
```

### Hotfix Process
```bash
# 1. Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix

# 2. Make minimal fix
git add .
git commit -m "fix: urgent production issue"

# 3. Deploy to production
# Create PR to main (fast-track review)
# Merge triggers production deployment

# 4. Sync back to dev
# Create PR from main to dev to keep branches in sync
```

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment
- **Purpose:** Testing and validation
- **Infrastructure:** Basic AWS services (no WAF, no custom domain)
- **Cost:** Minimal (mostly free tier)
- **Access:** API Gateway endpoint URL

### Production Environment
- **Purpose:** Live application for users
- **Infrastructure:** Full production setup (WAF, SSL, CDN)
- **Domain:** quizaxis.com with custom SSL certificate
- **Features:** Rate limiting, security headers, monitoring

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Infrastructure as Code
- CloudFormation templates for all AWS resources
- Environment-specific parameter files
- Automated rollback on deployment failures

### ✅ Automated Deployment
- GitHub Actions workflows for both environments
- Conditional deployment based on file changes
- Manual deployment options for flexibility

### ✅ Security
- Branch protection for production
- AWS IAM roles with least privilege
- SSL/TLS for all connections
- WAF protection for production
- API key authentication

### ✅ Monitoring
- CloudWatch logging for all services
- Deployment status tracking
- Health check endpoints
- Cost monitoring and alerts

### ✅ Documentation
- Complete setup and deployment guides
- Troubleshooting documentation
- Development workflow documentation
- Architecture and security documentation

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Testing (Recommended)
- Unit tests for backend and frontend
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Monitoring (Recommended)
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- User analytics and error tracking
- Custom CloudWatch dashboards
- Alerting for critical issues

### Advanced Features (Optional)
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Blue/green deployments for zero downtime
- Database migrations and versioning
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
