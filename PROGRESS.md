## Next Action Items

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1.1)

**🔄 CURRENT STEP**: Create GitHub repository and push code

1. **Create GitHub Repository** (5 minutes)
   - Follow steps in `GITHUB_CREATION_STEPS.md`
   - Repository name: `aws-ai-practitioner-quiz`
   - Connect local repository to GitHub remote
   - Push initial commit

2. **Initialize Backend Project** (after GitHub setup)
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm init -y
   npm install @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime @aws-sdk/client-bedrock
   npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node ts-node nodemon
   ```

3. **Configure AWS Credentials**
   - Set up AWS CLI credentials
   - Configure for us-west-2 region
   - Ensure Bedrock access permissions

3. **Create Basic Project Structure**
   ```
   backend/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── handlers/
   │   ├── services/
   │   │   └── bedrock.service.ts
   │   ├── utils/
   │   └── types/
   ├── tests/
   ├── package.json
   └── tsconfig.json
   ```
