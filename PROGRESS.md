## Development Notes

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Model Choice**: anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0
2. **Region**: us-west-2
3. **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript + AWS Lambda
4. **Frontend**: React with TypeScript + Vite
5. **Infrastructure**: CloudFormation + GitHub Actions
6. **Database**: DynamoDB for session storage
7. **Hosting**: S3 + CloudFront for frontend, API Gateway + Lambda for backend

### Current Blockers

- None at this time

### Technical Debt

- DynamoDB service implementation needs production testing
- CloudFormation templates need final validation
- Production environment variables need configuration

### Recent Achievements

- ‚úÖ Fixed quiz flow to continue through all 10 questions
- ‚úÖ Resolved backend session management and question validation
- ‚úÖ Fixed 500 error on results endpoint
- ‚úÖ Updated frontend to handle backend response structure correctly
- ‚úÖ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
