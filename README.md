*See firsthand how GitHub Copilot accelerated the development of this full-stack AWS AI quiz application - from initial setup to production deployment.*

---

This full-stack application was built leveraging GitHub Copilot to accelerate development, improve code quality, and enhance productivity. Here's how AI-powered development transformed the building process:

### **🚀 Project Initialization & Structure**

**Initial Setup Prompt:**
```
I want to develop an AWS bedrock powered quiz on AWS AI practitioner certification with 10 questions. The quiz needs to have the following features:

a. Adaptive quiz with progressively difficult questions.
b. Multiple choice with four questions with only 1 correct answer
c. If the answer is correct, it should be highlighted in green with a Next button activated so that user can progress to the next question.
d. If the answer is incorrect, the incorrect answer should be highlighted in red and the correct answer in green. In this case there should be an explanation box on UI that explains why the green answer is correct.
e. Track user progress and indicate the number of questions answered correctly.

First we will develop the backend that will establish connectivity with anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0 model from aws locally. We can build the entire AWS infra in us-west-2 region. The backend will be developed in nodejs.

Once we test this setup locally we will build rest of the features in backend and then test if it is working as expected. All the infrastructure will be hosted in aws. The backend will have an API gateway that has proxy integration with a lambda which in turn interacts with the bedrock api.

Once the entire backend is working as expected we will start work on frontend using react.js and to make sure it works well locally.

Next step will be to deploy these assets in aws by building a CI/CD setup using github actions and cloudformation template.

As a first step can you please generate a list of workflow for this project and a suitable github repository. Please ensure that the workflow has small moduler chunks so that we can test the development periodically and avoid any hallucinations. Please save the workflow as a readme file which we can refer along with way to guide the entire development as we progress.
```

**Result:** Copilot generated a comprehensive project structure with proper separation of concerns, optimized build configurations, and production-ready package dependencies.

### **⚡ Accelerated Backend Development**

**Service Creation Prompts:**
